# Basic Ass Accent Maker
This is basically a sketch program that i used as a basis to implement the accent system on Estação Pirata's SS14 fork.
## How to use
Don't, it's a test program. But if you wanna do you custom accent, put words and phrases that you want to replace in an json file, just like carioca.json and call it on the code, also if ya want to implement phonems induvidually, change the parse function to suit your needs.
